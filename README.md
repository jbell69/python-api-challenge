Observations:

1) It shows that the maximum temperature near the equator (Latitude 0) is much higher then at the Poles (Latitude -90/90).  Interestingly there is more colder city on average in the northern hemisphere then the southern hemisphere.

2) The evaluation of humidity looks that the equator and poles (latitude 0 and -90/90) have a higher humidity and the middle latitude have a lower humidity

3) The wind speed appears pretty constant throughout all latitudes with a few outliers at the poles.

4) Cloudiness appears to be unaffected by latitude but we would need to do appropriate statistical analysis to prove this.
